        <!-- 1. what is unit testing? -->
        <!-- Verifying the correctness of our scenarios -->
        <!-- unit testing - testing a small, isolated piece of our code, for example a function-->
        <!-- it happens before we deploy our code-->

        <!-- 2. why do we test out code? -->
        <!-- to make sure it works accordingly to the specifications -->
        <!-- to make our code safe and maintanable -->
        <!-- early bug detection, saves money -->
        <!-- good tests are a form of documentation -->

        <!-- 3. what is TDD? -->
        <!-- Test-Driven-Development -->

        <!-- 4. what are the advantages of TDD-->
        <!-- less bias when writing our code -->
        <!-- early bug notification -->
        <!-- confidence to refactor code -->
        <!-- good documentation for our code, so its easier for teams to collaborate-->
        <!-- Better designed and cleaner code -->
        <!--  -->
